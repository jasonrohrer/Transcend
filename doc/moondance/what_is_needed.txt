Hi Jason,

 

We are excited to have you be on board with this Independent Games product.
We're now at the point in development where we need some information from
you in order to best feature you, your company or group, and Transcend.
This email will outline the various items we will need for you to send to
us, along with the due dates for this information.  The good news is that
most (if not all) of the information you'll be providing to us is already
created, so this process should only take about 30 minutes.  

 


Description

Due Date


6 screen shots from the game you'll have on the product.  These screen shots
are for the general interface of the game to entice users to play your game.
A screen shot of your game may also be used on the product box, on sell
sheets, or the Moondance Games website.

out; please complete only sections 4 through 11.

Minimum system requirements.  We will be performing QA and running the

requirements, an approximation will suffice.

your company or group.  If you would like to have more information on your
company or group in the CD, you will have an opportunity to do so through
the "Extras" section.

Acceptable Name Abbreviation:  In some areas of the interface we may need to
shorten the name that appears for games with long names.  If the title of
your game is over 25 characters long, please let us know how you would like
the name abbreviated. 

8/12/05


Installer information: If you game already has an installer please let us
know if there is anything special the installer does. For example, are any
registry keys created by installer? Are any files installed in locations
other than the main installation folder?  Is there anything else unusual?

Instructions for your game.  Please send us the instructions for users to
play your game if you haven't already.  The preferred formats are txt and
html.

off, please send it to us.

Optional: "Extras."  Each game and developer will have an area associated
with them for extras you wish to share.  For example, you may wish to
include a link to your blog, or to an essay, or a movie file.   Or perhaps
you would like to explain why you decided to make your particular game, what
makes your game unique, or anything in particular you hoped to accomplish in
making it.

 Please note that we may edit your submissions for readability purposes.

questions, please contact either Brian Kingsley (
