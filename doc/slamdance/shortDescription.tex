\section{Short description}
Transcend is an abstract, 2D shooter.  The morphing graphics engine creates an alluring visual display.  Using musical power-ups, players simultaneously construct churning visual collages, arrange unique pieces of music, and strengthen their projectiles.  Transcend blurs the line between games and art---is it a video game or a multimedia sculpture?
