Two features set Transcend apart from other games.  First, its dynamic graphical engine, which can smoothly morph from one complex shape to another in realtime, produces striking displays.  Combining these dynamic shapes with subtle randomizations ensures that each new play through a Transcend level is visually different from the last.  The second novel feature is Transcend's musical power-up system.  As you play through a level, you are simultaneously assembling an abstract visual collage and arranging a unique piece of music.  Transcend merges video games with pure art---it can be viewed either as a game or as an interactive, multimedia sculpture.

Since Transcend's dynamic graphics are so different from what has come before, the visual experience is hard to explain in words.  Thus, it is best to present a brief example.  As your ship approaches the boss enemy, the boss transforms gradually in shape.  As you shoot the boss and drain its power, it morphs into another shape.  As you move away from the boss, it morphs into yet another shape, different from the first distant shape (since it is now weakened).  As the boss' health recovers, it transforms back into the first shape.  When you finally destroy the boss, it slides smoothly into a starburst explosion that bears no resemblance to any of the previous forms.  

All of these transitions are incredibly smooth, with no visible divisions between distinct shapes.  These transitions are achieved through a parameterized space of objects.  Such a space can be used to pick from an entire smooth spectrum of different shapes with a single parameter value.  By varying the parameter in time, a seemless transformation of complex objects occurs, similar to how a light might transition smoothly through the colors of the rainbow as the frequency parameter is varied.
