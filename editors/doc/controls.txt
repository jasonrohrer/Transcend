S  --  saves the control point to file
T  --  toggle between border vertex and triangle vertex edit modes
N  --  select the next vertex
M  --  switch into whole-object movement mode
E  --  exit edit modes (switch to view movement mode)
V  --  toggle grid visibility
L  --  toggle vertex grouping lock 
       (when locked, vertices that are in the same location move 
        and are colored together)
K  --  toggle color grouping lock 
       (when locked, colors that are the same location are adjusted together) 
F  --  toggle adjustment increment 
       (switch between 0.1 and 0.001 for values and 1 and 0.1 for movement)

z,Z -- decrease,increase the view zoom




c,C -- decrease,increase the number of rotated copies
x,X -- decrease,increase the rotated copy scale factor
d,D -- decrease,increase the scale factor for angles between rotated copies 
w,W -- decrease,increase the border width



In triangle vertex or border vertex edit mode:

r,R -- decrease,increase the red component of the selected vertex 
g,G -- decrease,increase the green component of the selected vertex 
b,B -- decrease,increase the blue component of the selected vertex 
a,A -- decrease,increase the alpha component of the selected vertex 

I  --  invert the color of the currently selected vertex

O  --  copy the color of the currently selected vertex to the color clipboard
U  --  set the color of the currently selected vertex to the clipboard color


Arrow keys -- move the selected vertex

Y  --  add a new triangle (3 new vertices) or border vertex, depending on the
       mode
H  --  remove the current triangle (3 vertices) or border vertex


In whole-object movement mode

Arrow keys -- move the whole object


In view movement mode
Arrow keys -- move the view
